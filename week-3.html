				<h3>Doucments on the third week:</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="well">
				<h3>The work flow by design a 3D printing product:</h3>
				<p>1. Using Rhino...... 3D desgin software to desgin the 3D model</p>
				<p>2. Slicing (Slic3r, Cura, Makerbot Print[xyz ware]) Make the material in the different slices, which denotes the printer to print.</p>
				<p>3. Send the Gcode to the printer and WAIT......</p>
				<h3>Some attentions that has to be paid to the printer:</h3>
				<p>1. The holding structure has to be considered ot there are something that will be hanging on the product.</p>
				<p>2. The thickness of the wall is no less than the nozzle size, which is 0.4mm in this 3D printer.</p>
				<p>3. The minimal gap of the seperation between moving parts has to be no less that the nozzle size, which is 0.4mm in this 3D printer.</p>
				<p>4. The overhang angle is usually no less than 45 degree, or the parts will fall during the process of printing.</p>
				<img src="picture/week-3/overhang_angle.png"
					 width="200"
					 style="display:block; margin:10px auto;">
				<p>5. Take care of the bridging distance. the bridge will look loke this if it is too long.</p>
				<img src="picture/week-3/too_long_bridge.png"
					 width="300"
					 style="display:block; margin:10px auto;">
			</div>
			
			<div class="well">
				<h3>Evaluating the test modelï¼š</h3>
				<p>First, here is the test model which was design by the teacher</p>
				<img src="picture/week-3/test-model1.png"
					 width="300"
					 style="display:block; margin:10px auto;">
				<p>By checking the test model, there are a little things that needs to be take care of for this specific typf of xyz Printer:</p>
				<p>1. There is not evident polygons on the surface of the half sphere. But the layer height is really a great factor that affect the final bueaty of the product.</p>
				<img src="picture/week-3/test-model-half-sphere.png"
					 width="300"
					 style="display:block; margin:10px auto;">
				<p>2. The overhang is quite better than what we had expected, the 30 degree part stays fine and there is no falling-downs. But it might because that there is another parts beside it and help the printer print it well.</p>
				<img src="picture/week-3/test-model-overhang.png"
					 width="150"
					 style="display:block; margin:10px auto;">
				<p>3. The bridge sorked just fine, but there is a little flaw right beneath the longest bridge.</p>
				<img src="picture/week-3/test-model-bridge.png"
					 width="300"
					 style="display:block; margin:10px auto;">
				<p>4. For the thinest wall, 0.4mm doesn't work very well. on the edge of the wall, the printer doesn't seem let out enough material.</p>
				<img src="picture/week-3/test-model-wall1.png"
					 width="200"
					 style="display:block; margin:10px auto;">
				<p>So these are what needs to be paying more attentions to.</p>			
			</div>
			
			<div class="well">
				<h3>Desgin my own 3D model:</h3>
				<p>By thinking what kind of model to desgin, it really showed that creativity is no an easy thing. Luckily, I found the need from my vibiration speaker.</p>
				<img src="picture/week-3/VibeTribeSpeaker.JPG"
					 width="300"
					 style="display:block; margin:10px auto;">
				<p>It can attach to almost anything in order to generate a loud voice, but I want to give it a fixed tool for its eternal 'thing'. This one is simple and the print file is also easy to make</p>
				<img src="picture/week-3/for_speaker_toprint.JPG"
					 width="300"
					 style="display:block; margin:10px auto;">
				<p>By the way, I found that "solid"-->"excursion" is a good method to transform a hook face into a solid, just like what I build the "bowl". However, the product doesn't seems really good.</p>
				<img src="picture/week-3/for_speaker_product1.JPG"
					 width="200"
					 style="display:block; margin:10px auto;">
				<p>It is too small and is not able to attach to the vibiration speaker.</p>
				<img src="picture/week-3/assist_apeaker_upper_layer.JPG"
					 width="300"
					 style="display:block; margin:10px auto;">
				<p>Also, in order to print faster, I chose the layer height as 0.3mm. The overhang angle is too low for the upper layer to connect to each other.</p>	
				
				<p>During the process, an idea sudden came up to me. Why don't I make a small idol which is just like the one I brought from U.S.?</p>
				<img src="picture/week-3/blessing_statues.JPG"
					 width="200"
					 style="display:block; margin:10px auto;">
				<p>Then, I started making</p>
				<img src="picture/week-3/idol_all_parts.JPG"
					 width="300"
					 style="display:block; margin:10px auto;">
				<p>First, I desgined all parts of the small statue. Also, I add a little feature so that the head can be opened, and I can put some amazing thing in it. But it could be too difficult for the printer, I made a simpler model whose head cannot be opened.</p>
				<img src="picture/week-3/idol_simple_print.JPG"
					 width="300"
					 style="display:block; margin:10px auto;">
				<p>Also, I made a model for the best senario, which has the full function by the desgin. As you can see, there is a little different in the neck of the idol.</p>
				<img src="picture/week-3/idol_best_print.JPG"
					 width="300"
					 style="display:block; margin:10px auto;">
				<p>The settings for the printer are as follows:</p>
				<img src="picture/week-3/idol_print_together_settings.JPG"
					 width="400"
					 style="display:block; margin:10px auto;">
				<p>Then I print the two plans together, in order to save some time and the machine.</p>
				<img src="picture/week-3/idol_print_together2.png"
					 width="300"
					 style="display:block; margin:10px auto;">
				<img src="picture/week-3/idol_print_together1.png"
					 width="300"
					 style="display:block; margin:10px auto;">
				<p>Unluckily, the product didn't come out as I had expected. The head of the best senario plan cannot be open, and the ring over the head was a mess, since what on the simple plan is a little better than that. Also, I thought the wings for this idol is still a little too big. And I redesgin the product and choose to print the head and the body seperately, and glue them together.</p>
				<img src="picture/week-3/idol_plan_B_design.JPG"
					 width="300"
					 style="display:block; margin:10px auto;">
				<p>And hoping the product will look like this.</p>
				<img src="picture/week-3/idol_plan_B_demo.JPG"
					 width="300"
					 style="display:block; margin:10px auto;">
