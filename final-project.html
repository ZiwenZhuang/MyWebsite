				<h3>Doucments on the final project:</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="well">
				<h2>Idea:</h2>
				<p>When I was soldering on the class, a problem came to me. As I was always do the project myself, or seperately with people, how can I document and take the picture for what I am doing?</p>
				<p>Then, an "easy" idea came to me. I can make a more protable camera or a wearable camera, which can help me record what I saw and for the document.</p>
				<h2>Investigation:</h2>
				<p>After searching online, there are a few posts that are doing the similar project. From <a herf="https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/26714/can-i-record-a-24-hour-video-on-the-raspberry-pi-with-camera-module">a website</a> it tells me why it is not practical simply record a video with the shanghaino board (aka arduino mini pro board). So I gave up on the video plan. But after more investigation, I saw someone asked about almost the same project from <a herf="http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=8028.0">arduino community</a>, which gave me a lot of confidence.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="well">
				<h3>Day 1: the camera module arrived</h3>
				<p>Before the camera module arrived, I did some search online to find out how to hack with the module, or <a href="">how to connect the camera module (ov7670) to the shanghaino</a>. By downloading the packages on that website and did as told, the compiler report an error.</p>
				<img src="picture/final-project/ov7670lib-compile-error.PNG"
					 width="600"
					 style="display:block; margin:10px auto;">
				<p>Basically, it means the function in cpp file doesn't match the declaration in the headfile. So I took a risk by changing the declaration on the function in the head file. (the code on the left is the old one) And I didn't change the code in the zip file.</p>
				<img src="picture/final-project/ov7670lib-change-head-file.PNG"
					 width="600px"
					 style="display:block; margin:10px auto;">
				<p>Then, the arduino IDE finished compiling with some warnings:</p>
				<img src="picture/final-project/ov7670lib-test-compile-warnings.PNG"
					 width="600"
					 style="display:block; margin:10px auto;">
				<p>After upload the code into the shanghaino board, the serial monitor shows what was expected (the SD card shield did not arrived yet)</p>
				<img src="picture/final-project/camera_test1_serial_result.PNG"
					 width="400"
					 style="display:block; margin:10px auto;">
			</div>
			<div class="well">
				<h3>Day 2: error</h3>
				<p>By rechecking <a ref="http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_85ffdf8a0102vni0.html">the guide web</a>, a serious problem occurred: How can I connect all these pins from the ov7670 module in terms of there are only a few pins avaliable on shanghaino board? The picture on the web showed something tricky</p>
				<img src="picture/final-project/ov7670_showed_connection.PNG"
					 width="450"
					 style="display:block; margin:10px auto">
				<h4 align="center">There is only 4 pins from the camera module!</h4>
				<p>So I re-search on <a href="https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a230r.1.14.75.5e9015105fqum9&id=40650349043&ns=1&abbucket=2#detail">TaoBao</a>, and I found this:</p>
				<img src="picture/final-project/new-camera-found.PNG"
					 width="500"
					 style="display:block; margin:auto">
				<p>As the picture shown, there is exactly the same as the back of the camera on the website! So, I went crazy and re-buy the camera module and waiting...</p>
			</div>
			<div class="well">
				<h3>Day 3: input -> output</h3>
				<p>By waiting for the modules for shanghaino, I test some part of the compoment from the classroom. I found the 4 digits segment display, but I couldn't find the data sheet for it. So, I test it on my own. And the diagram for the display is as follows:</p>
				<img src="picture/final-project/4digits-diaplay1.PNG"
					 width="500"
					 style="display:block; margin:auto">
				<img src="picture/final-project/4digits-diaplay2.PNG"
					 width="500"
					 style="display:block; margin:auto">
				<p>And here is the table for controlling the display. But the only way to show all 4 digits is to refresh the number one by one.</p>
				<img src="picture/final-project/4digits-diaplay-table.PNG"
					 width="500"
					 style="display:block; margin:auto">
				<p>Then, I wrote <a href="code/DigDisplay.zip">a library</a> for the controll of the display, which you can download and put it in the arduino IDE. But I will not update it further.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="well">
				<h3>Day 4: finished circuit</h3>
				<p>Finally, I got all the necessary components I need which are:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Arduino mini pro board</li>
					<li>The ov_0706 camera module</li>
					<li>The SD card shield</li>
					<li>The ultrasonic sensor</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Then, I can start testing the structure</p>
				<p>By found the graph online and modified the connection as I need, the connections for the pins on all these devices are as follows: (some of the power connections are ignored)</p>
				<img src="picture/final-project/final_board_connection.PNG"
					 width="500"
					 style="display:block; margin:auto">
				<p>Then everything goes well, and I wrote the <a href="/code/final_for_test.ino"><strong>code</strong></a> for the final product.</p>
				<p>Maybe at the final product, I will add a feature to show the statue using a buzzer, to let the user know whether the picture was token sucessfully.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="well">
				<h3>Day5: make the head band base</h3>
				<p>At first, I was going to print the base through the 3D printer. Luckily or unluckily, the xyz printer keeps telling me that the module I desgined was too big, and asked me kindly whether I want to transfrom it in to a smaller size... So, I decided to make the base through the laser cutter.</p>
				<p>And this is the moduel I desgined based on the 3D module which was a scan of my head.</p>
				<img src="picture/final-project/head-band-base-desgin.PNG"
					 width="600"
					 style="display:block; margin:auto">
				<p>Then I set the <strong>power to 70% with 0.5 speed</strong>, to cut out the band using the laser cutter.</p>
				<img src="picture/final-project/head-band-base-cutting.PNG"
					 width="500"
					 style="display:block; margin:auto">
				<img src="picture/final-project/head-band-base-product.PNG"
					 width="500"
					 style="display:block; margin:auto">
				<p>However, the initial one was a little too big to be worn on my head. Luckily again, the smaller one fit my head perfectly:)</p>
				<p>As you can see, I desgined many joints for the components to fit in the base. Then I can 3D print the parts that holds the electric components</p>
			</div>
			<div class="well">
				<h3>Day6: First joints</h3>
				<p>By desgining the joints which would fit into the head band base, I print the joints as well as the base holding the battery.</p>
				<img src="picture/final-project/battery-base-print1-settings.PNG"
					 width="500"
					 style="display:block; margin:auto">				
				<p>However, the joints are too big which toke me quite a while to make them smaller <strong>(0.5mm thinner than desgined)</strong></p>
				<img src="picture/final-project/battery-base-product1.png"
					 width="500"
					 style="display:block; margin:auto">
				<p>And the ideal figure of this joints with the battery base is like this:</p>
				<img src="picture/final-project/battery-base-product2.png"
					 width="500"
					 style="display:block; margin:auto">
